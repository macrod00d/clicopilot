# CLI Copilot
[![clicopilot](https://i.ibb.co/j5pK4Ps/clicopilot.webp)](https://ibb.co/mBxszVg)

## How to Use

```
cargo run -- "command prompt"
```

The app will generate commands for you based on a description, and will also answer questions. This version currently only supports powershell, the next release will add support for bash as well (with autodetection hopefully). 

I will also provide sample alias commands to map the copilot to ?? for easy use.
